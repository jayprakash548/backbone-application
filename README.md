Here! you'll find about Backbone.js Features
==========================
Following is a list of the most prominent features of Backbone.js:
1. Backbone.js allows developers to develop one page applications and front-end much easier and better using JavaScript functions.
2. Backbone provides different types of building blocks like models, views, events, routers and collections for assembling client side web applications.
3. In Backbone.js when model changes, it automatically updates the HTML of your application.
4. Backbone.js is a simple library used to separate business and user interface logic.
5. Backbone.js is a free and open source library and contains over 100 available extensions.
6. Backbone.js makes your code simple, systematic and organized. It acts like a backbone for your project.
7. Backbone.js manages the data model which includes the user data and display that data at the server side with the same format written at client side.
8. Backbone.js has soft dependency with jQuery and hard dependency with Underscore.js.
9. Backbone.js allows developers to create client side web applications or mobile applications in well structured and organized format.

Now, its time to work on Backbone.js Architecture
==========================
The Backbone.js architecture specifies the structure to the web applications that allows users to separate business logic and user interface logic. 
The diagram that we have discussed in this video session contains following module:
  #HTTP Request
  #Router
  #View
  #Events
  #Model
  #Collection
  
HTTP Request:
============
The HTTP requests are sent by client to a server in the form of request message where web browsers, search engines etc. acts like HTTP clients.

Router:
============
Routers are used to route client side applications and connects them to actions and events using URL's.

View:
============
The Backbone.js view specifies how and what to display from application.

Events:
============
Event is the main part of an application. It binds user's custom events to an application.

Model:
============
Model is known as core of the JavaScript application. It retrieves and populates the data. Models consist of data of an application and logic of the data and represents basic data object in the framework.

Collection:
============
Collection is a set of models used to bind events, when a modification is made in the collection. In collection, there is a list of models that can be processed in the loop and support sorting and filtering.
